Telecom Churn Case Study

 Business Problem Overview
In the telecom industry, customers can choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.
For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal.
To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.
In this project, you will analyze customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of churn. 

Understanding and Defining Churn
There are two major payment models in the telecom industry: postpaid (customers pay a monthly/annual bill after using the services) and prepaid (customers pay/recharge with a certain amount in advance and then use the services).
In the postpaid model, when customers want to switch to another operator, they usually inform the existing operator to terminate the services, and you directly know that this is an instance of churn.
But, on the other hand, the prepaid model leaves much to be desired because those who want to shift to a new network simply cease using the services without any notice, and it is tough to know if somebody has indeed churned or has just not used the services for a period of time; a person could go abroad on holiday for a month or two and then decide to resume use again.
Hence, churn prediction is typically more important (and less trivial) for prepaid customers, and the word â€˜churn €™ must be defined precisely.  Moreover, prepaid is the most common model in India and southeast Asia, whereas postpaid is more common in Europe in North America.
This project is based on the Indian and Southeast Asian market.
